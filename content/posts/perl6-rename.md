I saw this referenced today on 
[lwn.net](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/08/is-perl-6-being-renamed.html)

IMHO if you make a language incompatible with previous versions it should be
renamed.  I've thought this many times with the python2 -> python3 change.  I
suppose some will find this irritating, but I think it would make
things less confusing.
