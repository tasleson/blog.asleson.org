American water heater company, the maker of the water heater I installed issued 
me a return authorization number for the water heater that would not run when 
installed per the instructions. I installed the new one (1/5/2013) and this one 
works better (it will start), but still not great. It makes noise when starting 
and the flame is quite yellow and has bad shape. I have posted videos of the 
start and flame for technical support to look at.

This is the replacement unit starting : [http://youtu.be/\_Bb3IgamFdo](http://youtu.be/_Bb3IgamFdo "noisy start")

I contacted technical support again via email and sent them video footage of 
the poor flame. After a few days technical support contacted me again and 
FedEx’d me a smaller orifice to try, a #30. The heater comes standard with a #29. 
I got this smaller orifice and installed it and the unit ran very poorly

At this point I gave up, I contacted a local contractor and scheduled an 
install of a new furnace and water heater. I was done trying to make this 
water heater work.

The replacement water heater was returned to Lowe’s for a refund. Lowe’s 
was very helpful throughout this very frustrating experience.
