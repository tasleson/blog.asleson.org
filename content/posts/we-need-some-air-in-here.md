In a previous posting I mentioned running into an issue with our water 
heater failing to draft when all the exhaust fans and clothes dryer 
running.  I did some research and through testing I thought the entire 
issue could be resolved by adding more “make-up air”.   Thus I added a 
6″ duct into our mechanical room.  This was in addition to our existing 
5″. You would think that after having ~48″ sq. of open hole to the 
outside would mitigate any possible negative pressure, but you would 
be wrong.  The water heater still failed to draft in worst case CAZ 
testing. I called a local HVAC contractor to evaluate.  They spent 
3 hours trying different things, including adding 3′ to our chimney, 
but no joy!
